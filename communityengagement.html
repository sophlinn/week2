    <h2>Partnership with Detroit Boxing</h2>
    <P>Flow In Color is striving to make yoga more inclusive to youth in Ann Arbor and surrounding areas. As part of this initiative, we have partnered with Detroit Boxing Club; a non-profit organization that encourages children to participate in after school activity. </P>
    <P>Through generous donations by the public, in 2018 we were able to provide 30 children from the gym with a day of mindfulness and yoga at FIC18 in Ann Arbor. As we grow, we will continue to find more organizations to support. If you are in a position to donate, please click the button below to help share the power of yoga!</P>
    <p>Alternatively, if you are a non-profit organization that would benefit from this service, please contact us on the contact page. </p>
